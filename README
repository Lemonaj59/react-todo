# react_todolist

## Description
This is a simple todo application, I used `React` for the Front-end. I designed this with classes using React.Component, 
so the readability of the code is more clear. The Goal of this application was to make components and pass the state
 that was needed to the components. 

On my server, I used Node.js with Express.js. while Express.js handled my asynchronous query calls to my database.
Manipulating data as needed for my database and front-end to recognize. Lastly I used postgresql as my database.

I dockerized my psql server, and on initial build it will create the schema. This also adds baseline
data(user, password, lists, and items) for testing purposes.
Also dockerized my node.js server, making it install my node packages. I also made it so you have to be in the directory
to make changes, and cannot add changes while interacting with the docker container. 
I did this just for a bit more security. 


## Priority Plans
* Updating edge cases on creating user
* Updating adding item to list, done column to true or false setting
* Hosting website
* Putting my server and database on the Google cloud services


## Future Plans
* Putting a background and making website more apealing
* User settings/profile 
* Random daily tasks on homepage. 
* Hover description on buttons, to give discription
* Add modal for lists when user is about to delete lists
